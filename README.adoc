* _LIFE_ is a desktop application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
It is a one stop application for NUS students to manage their student life in terms of
** Meeting deadlines
** Managing finances
** Planning and recording workouts
** Forming good habits to improve lifestyle
* Features: Task List, Expenditure List, Workout Tracker, Habit Tracker and Contact List.
* *Written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
