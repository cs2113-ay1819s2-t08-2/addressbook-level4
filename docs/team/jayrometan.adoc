= [teal big]#*Jerome Tan* - Project Portfolio for _LIFE_#


== Overview

This Project Portfolio documents my role and contributions to the project _LIFE_.

== About the project

In our second year of university, my team and I were tasked with enhancing a basic address book
application. Our enhancement was a morph from a given address book into a self-improvement lifestyle management application
called _LIFE_ (Lifestyle Improvement For Everyone) that uses the Command Line Interface (CFI). +

This enhanced application helps people who are seeking to better their lives achieve their goals.
This is done through keeping track of their tasks and documenting of their expenditure and physical activity, thereby increasing their mindfulness of their daily lives.

== My role

For this project, I served the role as a team leader through steering the direction of the project
and the management of all the deadlines. +

In the technical aspect, my role was to design and write code for the Task feature.
In the non-technical aspect, I am in charge of the content and layout of the documentations.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements and documentations in detail, other additional enhancements that I have made as well as the relevant sections that I have added to the user and developer guide in relation to these enhancements.


Note the following symbols used in this document:

TIP: A grey highlight (called a mark-up) e.g. `TASK` indicates that it is a Class
or a command word that can be inputted into the command line
and executed by the application.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation and other helpful contributions
that i have contributed to the team project.

To aid the potential visualization of my work, here is the user interface of _LIFE_.

* *Major Feature #1*: implemented the `Task` feature.
** +What does it do:+
*** Allows an individual to keep track of his tasks through adding a task
*** Help organize and prioritize the tasks through editing, deleting and sorting
the tasks. It also has a tick task command, where the ticked task will be added
into the completed task list.
** +Justification+
*** In the modern world, many people are increasingly bombarded with tasks to do,
and they tend to forget what tasks they have until the deadline has reached.
This application therefore helps them remember their tasks.
*** The completed task list serves as a motivation booster to users
when they see how many tasks they have completed so far.


* Project Management
** Created the organization and forked the repo. Also, all the labels and milestones for the repo. This includes wrapping
up the milestones and moving the incomplete tasks to the future milestones.
