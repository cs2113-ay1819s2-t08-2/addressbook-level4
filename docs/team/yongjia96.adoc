= [teal big]#*Pang Yong Jia* - Project Portfolio for _LIFE_#


== Overview

This project portfolio was written to document my role and contributions to the project _LIFE_.

== About the project

In my 4th semester of university, my team and I were tasked with enhancing a basic address book software over the entire semester.
We chose to morph it into a lifestyle manager called _LIFE_, which stands for Lifestyle Improvement For Everyone.

This application aims to help people to better manage their daily lives, in which we decided to include 4 main features, namely
the *Task*, *Expenditure*, *Workout* and *Habit* tracker. These features will help to manage their tasks' deadlines, daily spending,
exercise routine as well as setting aims for good habits, thereby helping them to manage their daily lives better.


== My role

My role in the project was to implement the `record` and `workout` features for the workout tracker. I am also tasked to design
the model component for the `workout` class, as well as the data structures needed for the storage component for any `workout`
related features. I also need to ensure that the UI component for my workout tracker is displayed properly.

Note the following symbols used in this document:

TIP: A grey highlight (called a mark-up) e.g. `TASK` indicates that it is a Class
or a command word that can be inputted into the command line
and executed by the application.
