== Introduction

StudentHandBook is an one stop application made for NUS students to manage and improve their student life.
More importantly, StudentHandBook is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, StudentHandBook can get your
contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to Section 2, “Quick Start”
to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `8` (revision `1.8.0_201` or later) installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Only Java 8 is supported. +
This app will not work with later major Java releases such as Java 9, 10, 11, etc.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your StudentHandBook.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
